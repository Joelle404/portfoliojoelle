        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>I am a student at Bethlehem University, a distinguished Catholic institution situated in the heart of Bethlehem, in the West Bank. Notably, it stands as the very first higher education establishment to be established in the occupied Palestinian territories. I applied to it not only because it offers the academic program I am passionate about but also because of its convenient proximity to my home.</p>

        <h3>Role Model</h3>
        <p>I don't have a specific role model because I believe that expecting someone to be perfect in order to serve as a role model is an unrealistic standard. No one is flawless, and I prefer to draw inspiration and guidance from the positive qualities and experiences of various people rather than putting the weight of perfection on one individual.</p>
